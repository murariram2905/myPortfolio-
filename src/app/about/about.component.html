    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in building responsive, user-centric web applications using modern 
      technologies like Angular and React. With a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and component-based architecture,
      I enjoy turning complex problems into intuitive, scalable interfaces.
      <br/><br/>

      I've worked on real-world projects ranging from personal websites to collaborative team dashboards, and I'm constantly 
      expanding my skill set through hands-on experience and certifications. Whether it's routing in Angular or creating dynamic 
      UI in React, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that enhances user experience.
      <br/><br/>

      When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring new places, reading, or diving into music to recharge my creativity.
